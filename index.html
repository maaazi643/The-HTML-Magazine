      <h2>Understanding the Core of Web Development: HTML</h2>
      <p>
        The backbone of all modern websites and web applications lies in three
        core technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These form the
        foundational trio of web languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's delve into HTML in this article. We'll explore its significance
        and reasons why it's a beneficial skill to acquire.
      </p>
      <h3>Defining HTML</h3>
      <p>
        HTML, or <strong>H</strong>yper <strong>T</strong>ext
        <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage, is a markup language
        used by web developers to structure and define the content of a webpage.
        Note that it's distinct from a programming language.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML is comprised of various elements that denote different content
        types like text, links, headings, images, videos, and more. Web browsers
        interpret HTML code to display web pages.
      </p>

      <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The opening tag</li>
        <li>The closing tag</li>
        <li>The actual element</li>
      </ol>
